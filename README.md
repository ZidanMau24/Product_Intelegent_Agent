AI Product Intelligence Agent (Gemini Edition)A streamlined intelligence hub for Go-To-Market (GTM) and Product Marketing teams, powered by a multi-agent system running on Google's Gemini model.This application transforms scattered public web data into concise, actionable launch insights. It leverages a coordinated team of specialized AI agents, built with LangChain/LangGraph, to perform deep analysis on competitor launches, market sentiment, and performance metrics.‚ú® FeaturesMulti-Agent Coordination: A sophisticated team of AI agents works together, managed by a supervisor who delegates tasks and synthesizes results.Specialized Roles:üîç Product Launch Analyst: Delivers an evidence-backed breakdown of a rival's launch strategy, including positioning, differentiators, and channel mix.üí¨ Market Sentiment Specialist: Consolidates social media chatter and review themes, highlighting key positive and negative drivers.üìà Launch Metrics Specialist: Scours the web for publicly available KPIs like adoption numbers, press coverage, and user engagement signals.Powered by Gemini: Utilizes Google's powerful Gemini 1.5 Pro model for high-quality analysis and reasoning.Live Web Access: Integrates with Firecrawl to search and scrape real-time data from the web, ensuring insights are current and relevant.Interactive UI: A clean and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit, allowing for easy interaction and clear presentation of results.Secure API Key Handling: Standard sidebar inputs for securely providing API keys.üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: The Multi-Agent ArchitectureThis application uses LangGraph to create a cyclic, stateful graph that represents the team of agents. This allows for more complex and realistic agent interactions than a simple chain.The Supervisor: Acts as the team lead. When a user makes a request, the Supervisor is the first to see it. Its job is to analyze the request and delegate it to the most appropriate specialist agent.The Specialists: Each specialist (Launch Analyst, Sentiment Specialist, Metrics Specialist) is an expert in its domain. It receives the task from the Supervisor, uses its tools (Search and Crawl) to gather information from the web, and then formulates a detailed report.The Final Report: The specialist's report is sent back to the Supervisor. The Supervisor reviews the report and, if it meets the requirements, formats it into a final, polished response for the user. This ensures the output is consistent and high-quality.This coordinated workflow allows the system to handle complex queries by breaking them down and assigning them to the right "expert," mimicking how a real human intelligence team operates.üöÄ Tech StackFrontend: StreamlitBackend & Agent Framework: LangChain & LangGraphLLM: Google Gemini 1.5 ProWeb Scraping/Crawling: FirecrawlEnvironment Management: python-dotenv‚öôÔ∏è Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to run the application on your local machine.1. Clone the Repositorygit clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>
2. Create a Virtual EnvironmentIt's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.# For Windows
